Features
==
- **Add Name**: Type “+” and the text to add at the end of the current layer name (e.g., + button).

- **Sequence**:  Type “%n” to name layer in sequence. You can also use “%-n” for reverse order. The more Ns you add the more digits it will add (e.g. , %nnn = 001 etc.).

- **Move Original Text**: Type "%curr" to keep the original anywhere in the new name (e.g., prefix %curr suffix).

- **Add Width and Height**: Type "%w" or "%h" to add the width or height of the layer  (e.g., Icon %w x %h). *Great addition by @GU5TAF*
