Features

- **Sequence**:  Type “%N” to name layer in sequence. You can also use “%n” for reverse order. The more Ns you add the more digits it will add (e.g. , Item %NN).

- **Move Original Text**: Type "\*" to keep the original anywhere in the new name (e.g., Option \* icon).

- **Add Width and Height**: Type "%w" or "%h" to add the width or height of the layer  (e.g., Icon %w x %h). *Great addition by @GU5TAF*
